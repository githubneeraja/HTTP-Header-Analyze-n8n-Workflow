# 🧠 HTTP Header Analyze — n8n Security Workflow

This project is an **automated website security auditing workflow** built in [n8n](https://n8n.io).  
It analyzes **HTTP headers**, **client-side vulnerabilities**, and **page security configurations** using AI-powered analysis.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The workflow performs a full web security audit in real time by combining HTTP inspection and AI-driven analysis.

### 🔍 Features
- 🧩 Fetches HTTP response headers from a target URL
- 🧠 Uses **OpenAI (GPT-4.1-mini)** for intelligent analysis
- 🧱 Detects missing or misconfigured security headers
- 🍪 Audits insecure cookie configurations
- 🔒 Reviews client-side HTML for vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, leaks)
- 🧾 Grades website security (A–F)
- 📧 Sends an **email security report** via Gmail

## 🧰 Workflow Components

| Node Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **Landing Page URL** | Form Trigger | Collects user input (URL) to scan |
| **HTTP Request** | HTTP Node | Fetches headers and page content |
| **Code in JavaScript** | Code Node | Formats HTTP headers |
| **AI Agent** | LangChain Agent | Analyzes HTTP headers and security configuration |
| **AI Agent1** | LangChain Agent | Scans HTML content for client-side vulnerabilities |
| **Merge** | Merge Node | Combines results from both AI analyses |
| **Aggregate** | Aggregate Node | Merges structured output |
| **Code in JavaScript1** | Code Node | Grades security (A, B, C, F) and formats results |
| **Code in JavaScript2** | Code Node | Builds a professional HTML audit report |
| **Send a message** | Gmail Node | Emails the final security report |

## 🧮 Security Grading Logic

The system assigns a grade based on essential security headers:

| Header | Points Deducted if Missing |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Content-Security-Policy | −20 |
| Strict-Transport-Security | −20 |
| X-Content-Type-Options | −10 |
| X-Frame-Options | −10 |
| Referrer-Policy | −10 |

**Grades:**
- 🟢 A → 90–100  
- 🟡 B → 75–89  
- 🟠 C → 60–74  
- 🔴 F → Below 60

## 📧 Email Output Example

Each scan result is emailed to the configured Gmail account with the following sections:

```

## Website Security Audit Report

URL: [https://example.com](https://example.com)
Grade: A
Timestamp: 2025-11-02T18:45:00Z

Configuration Audit:
[List of secure/missing headers]

Vulnerability Audit:
[List of detected issues or “No vulnerabilities found”]

```
